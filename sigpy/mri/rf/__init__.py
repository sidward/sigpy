"""This MRI submodule contains functions and classes for MRI pulse design.

It currently provides tools for SLR pulse design and RF pulse simulation.
Tools for designing pTx, adiabatic, and other types of rf pulses,
as well as gradient and trajectory designers will be added soon.

Explore RF design tutorials at `sigpy-rf-tutorials`_.

See in-progress features at `sigpy-rf`_.
